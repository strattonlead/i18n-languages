# i18n-languages
This project heavily uses resources from https://github.com/umpirsky and extends the .NET CultureInfo object. The aim of the project is to provide all languages translated to all languages (well to be honest all languages is simlpy impossible, but the 'common' ones should be possible)

You can see a live demo of it at https://i18n-languages.com/

Further extensions are all countries translated to all languages and all currency infos.

Project import in progress!
